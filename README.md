# Task Management App

This is a full-stack project utilizing JavaScript, React for the frontend, and Python with Django for the backend.

## Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Frontend:**
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory in your terminal.
   - Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
   - After installation, run `npm start` to start the frontend server.
   - Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) to access the frontend.

2. **Backend:**
   - In the parent directory in your terminal.
   - Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
   - Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   - After installing dependencies, run `python manage.py runserver` to start the Django server.
   - Access the API endpoints using the following URLs:
     - [http://127.0.0.1:9000/api/](http://127.0.0.1:9000/api/)
     - [http://127.0.0.1:9000/api/tasks/](http://127.0.0.1:9000/api/tasks/)

Ensure both the frontend and backend servers are running to interact with the Task Management App effectively.
